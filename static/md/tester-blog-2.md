This way I can write code with fonts, and attach latex

I had to write some more text
because the markdown is bad. HTML escaping isn't working andI don't have time

```html

<h1>hello</h1>
```
It's all seamless

## \\( \frac{\pi}{40} \\)

```css
.article1-head {
    background-color: red;
}

.note-container {
    margin: 3%;
    background-color: #81cb321f;
    padding: 3%;
    border-radius: 10px;
}

.codehilite {
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.486);
}

```
