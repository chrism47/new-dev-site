            An artistic CS project. al-g is a 3D art generator and a DSA visualizer currently
            in the very early stages of development. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Pattern, composition, color all in a 3d environment; all based around
          visualizations generated by direct application of 
          data structures and algorithms. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So far it's just a few adjustments and trees but much more to come!
